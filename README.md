Basic Weather API
This project consists of a simple Python script (APP.py) designed to interact with the OpenWeatherMap API and provide current weather information for a specified city. The script prompts the user to input a city name, makes a request to the OpenWeatherMap API, and then displays the retrieved weather and temperature data.
